						<p>Data leakage is the big challenge in front of the industries & different institutes. Though there are number of systems designed for the data security by using different encryption algorithms, there is a big issue of the integrity of the users of those systems. It is very hard for any system administrator to trace out the data leaker among the system users. It creates a lot many ethical issues in the working environment of the office. </p>
						<p>The data leakage detection industry is very
heterogeneous as it evolved out of ripe product lines of
leading IT security vendors. A broad arsenal of enabling
technologies such as firewalls, encryption, access control,
identity management, machine learning content/context-based
detectors and others have already been
incorporated to offer protection against various facets of
the data leakage threat.</p>
